# School_District_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to help Maria, our chief data analyst friend for the city school district, with combing through all of the data for the school district in order to better inform the schools on what they need to work on. This is based on the standardized testing data that she's been given and will be presented to the district's board for review, along with our analysis of the data and any recommendations that we might have.

### Challenge Overview

After looking through the initial batch of data we've been told that there's evidence of academic dishonesty with Thomas High School's 9th graders. We've been asked to scrub their data from the rolls and then complete the analysis again, then compare the two analyses to see what effect was had on the district.
